Very nice, I like the way you've managed to do the task. It is innovative and no one made it like you :))

I like it, but there is small problem with this approach, because when you click several times on the same button, you get
different picture, this is strange behavior. Other than that everything seems really nice, here you can check Andrey's 
homework and see how he managed to do the task, it's simple and straightforward.

    changeImage(event) {
        this.setState({imageUrl: event.target.getAttribute('data-image-url')})
    }
    
    <Button name="Image One" imageChangeHandler={this.changeImage} imageUrl="https://img.rasset.ie/0010809f-500.jpg"/>
    
    const Button = ({ name, imageChangeHandler, imageUrl }) => {
      return (
          <button onClick={imageChangeHandler} data-image-url={imageUrl}>{name}</button>
      )
    }
